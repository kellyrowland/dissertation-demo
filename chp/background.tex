This chapter provides information relevant to the core parts of this research.

\section{Approaches to Nuclear Engineering}

\subsection{Experimental Methods}

\subsubsection{Beam Experiments}

\subsubsection{Reactor Measurements}

\paragraph{Gold Foil Experiments}\mbox{} \\

\paragraph{Thermal Measurements}\mbox{} \\

\subsection{Computational Methods}

\subsubsection{Parallel Computing}

Big computers are useful but difficult to use.

\paragraph{Shared Memory}\mbox{} \\

OpenMP is a good idea for the shared memory model.

\paragraph{Distributed Memory}\mbox{} \\

MPI might be better for working with distributed memory.

\section{Previous Work}

Many people have worked on nuclear engineering. Here we'll highlight important and relevant
work from the history of nuclear engineering.

\subsection{Important Experiments}

Many interesting experiments have been performed.

\subsubsection{CP-1}

Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1) was the world's first nuclear reactor.

\subsection{Important Software}

Software development has taken place as well.

\subsubsection{MCNP}

A lot of people use MCNP \cite{mcnp}. It is good practice to cite software.
